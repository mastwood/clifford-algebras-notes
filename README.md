# Clifford Algebras
My notes from PMATH945 - Clifford Algebras, Spinors, and Calibrations at University of Waterloo. 
The course was taught by Spiro Karigiannis in Fall 2020. Spiro has signed off on these being posted online. 
We plan to expand the notes with a few more sections and exercises, before publishing them as a book.
